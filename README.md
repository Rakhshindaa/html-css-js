##  HTML / CSS / JavaScript Coding Challenges (Beginner → Medium)

### 1) **Simple Counter**

Create a webpage with a number displayed and two buttons: **Increment** and **Decrement**.

* Clicking “Increment” increases the number by 1.
* Clicking “Decrement” decreases it by 1, but the number should never go below 0.

**Focus:** DOM manipulation, `addEventListener`, updating text content.

---

### 2) **Live Text Mirror**

Build a text input and a paragraph. As the user types into the input, the paragraph updates instantly to show the same text.

**Focus:** `input` event, reading `value`, dynamic updates.

---

### 3) **Dark Mode Toggle**

Create a button that toggles the webpage between normal and dark mode.

* Clicking the button should change the background color and text color.
* The button text should update to reflect the current state (“Enable Dark Mode” / “Disable Dark Mode”).

**Focus:** class toggle, CSS variables or classes.

---

### 4) **Dynamic List Filter**

Display a list of items (e.g., fruits). Add a search input above it.

* As the user types, show only items that include the typed text (case-insensitive).

**Focus:** filtering arrays, rendering list elements dynamically.

---

### 5) **Form Validation**

Build a login form with **Email** and **Password** fields and a submit button.

* Show an error if the email doesn’t include `@`.
* Show an error if the password is shorter than 6 characters.

**Focus:** form submission, validation messages, preventing default behavior.

---

### 6) **Character Counter with Limit**

Add a textarea with a live character counter below.

* If characters exceed a set limit (e.g., 100), show a warning message (and optionally disable further typing).

**Focus:** string `.length`, real-time updates, conditionals.

---

### 7) **To-Do List**

Create a todo list: an input field + “Add” button.

* Add tasks to a list below.
* Each list item should have a delete button to remove it.

**Focus:** arrays, events, updating DOM lists.

---

### 8) **Image Gallery with Active Image**

Build an image gallery with thumbnails below a larger preview area.

* Clicking a thumbnail updates the main image.

**Focus:** handling lists of images, event targets.

---

### 9) **Accordion / Collapsible Sections**

Create multiple accordion panels.

* Only one panel should be open at a time.
* Clicking a panel header expands its content and collapses the others.

**Focus:** show/hide panels, classes, iterative event listeners.

---

### 10) **Color Picker Box**

Make a colored box and several buttons (e.g., Red, Green, Blue).

* Clicking a button changes the box’s background color.

**Focus:** updating style properties via JS.
